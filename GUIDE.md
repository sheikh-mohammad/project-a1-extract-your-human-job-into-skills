# A1 Extract Your Human Job Into Skills

> Active

Turn what you already do into 3–5 focused, reusable capabilities that replace parts of your own job and could help others with similar work.

## Actions

1. Describe your daily/weekly work to Claude Code
2. Identify repeatable cognitive tasks (decisions, writing, analysis, coordination)
3. Implement 3–5 narrow, measurable skills that: (1) you actually use, (2) save time or reduce mental load, (3) could be reused by someone like you

## Constraints

- Skills must be small (100–900 LOC is fine)
- Each skill must have one clear outcome
- Each skill must be measurable

## Deliverables

- 3–5 skills (Claude Code / General Agent)
- A short README.md describing what each skill replaces and time saved / quality improved
- One 60–90 second demo (screen recording) — Use Loom Chrome Extension to record easily
