## Project Description

Turn what you already do into 3–5 focused, reusable agent skills.

## Additional Instructions

Checkpoint A1 is about turning your real work into usable agent skills. Start by describing what you actually do each day or week to Claude Code—writing, analyzing, deciding, coordinating, or managing information. From this, identify repeatable tasks and build 3 to 5 small, focused agent skills that handle those tasks for you. Each skill should do one clear thing, be measurable, and noticeably save time or reduce mental effort. These are not demos or practice exercises—they must be skills you personally use. By the end of this checkpoint, you should have a small library of reusable capabilities that replace parts of your own job and could help others with similar work. If at least one skill replaces a manual task for you this week, you’ve completed the checkpoint.
