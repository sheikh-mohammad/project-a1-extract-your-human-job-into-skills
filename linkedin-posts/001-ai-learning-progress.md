# My Journey Learning AI & Building Agent Skills 🤖

Excited to share my progress as I dive deeper into AI development!

Over the past weeks, I've been building agent skills and exploring how to extract human jobs into automated capabilities. It's fascinating to see how complex tasks can be broken down into discrete, automatable components.

Key learnings so far:
✅ Breaking complex workflows into atomic tasks
✅ Understanding prompt engineering principles
✅ Creating reusable skill modules
✅ Implementing atomic commit principles for iterative development

The visual represents my growth trajectory - from concept to implementation, building in public and documenting the journey.

What's your experience with AI automation? I'd love to hear about your own learning journey!
