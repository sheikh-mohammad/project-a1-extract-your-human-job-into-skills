Starting something exciting today! 🚀

I've kicked off my "21 Days of Problem Solving with Python" series, and I'm happy to share that Day 1 is complete!

So what's this all about? Well, I wanted to build a strong foundation in Python by tackling progressively challenging problems. Day 1 focused on "Simple Number Problems" - getting comfortable with loops, basic arithmetic, and step-by-step thinking patterns.

Some of the problems I worked on:
• Print numbers 1 to N and N to 1
• Identify even numbers
• Calculate sums of natural numbers
• Compute factorials
• Generate square and cube patterns
• Check divisibility

It's amazing how these "simple" problems really make you think! 😄 Each one builds on the previous concept, creating a solid base for more complex challenges.

I believe in the power of daily practice. Small, consistent steps lead to big results over time. And that's exactly what this 21-day journey is about.

If you're looking to strengthen your Python fundamentals or just curious about problem-solving, why not join me? Day 1 was just the beginning - there are 20 more days of challenges ahead covering everything from loops to arrays to advanced concepts.

What's the best programming challenge you've tackled recently? Would love to hear about your own learning journey in the comments! 👇
