# LinkedIn Post Visual Generation Instructions

Follow these steps to generate your LinkedIn post visual:

## Step 1: Access Google Gemini
1. Go to https://gemini.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Wait for the interface to load completely

## Step 2: Generate the Image
1. Click on the image generation feature (usually accessed by clicking the "+" icon or image button)
2. Copy and paste the following prompt:

"Create a modern, minimal, professional tech-focused square image (1:1 aspect ratio) for a LinkedIn post about AI learning progress. The design should feature:

- Neutral background with soft blue/purple accent colors
- Clean layout with strong visual hierarchy
- Futuristic but simple design elements
- Space for text overlay at the top and bottom
- Tech-themed elements like abstract geometric shapes representing AI, neural networks, or digital progress
- No cartoon or playful illustrations - keep it professional
- Design should feel suitable for a tech student building in public
- Include subtle gradients and soft shadows
- Leave clear space for text overlay without cluttering
- Modern typography space suggestions
- Minimalist data visualization elements or abstract tech symbols
- Professional color scheme that works well for a LinkedIn post
- Abstract representation of learning progress, AI building, and skill development
- Sophisticated color palette with muted tones
- Balanced composition with proper visual breathing room
- High visual hierarchy with clear focal points
- Space for a title at the top and details at the bottom
- Professional aesthetic suitable for career networking"

3. Select the 1:1 aspect ratio option
4. Click Generate

## Step 3: Download the Image
1. Once the image is generated, right-click on it and select "Save image as..."
2. Save it to the graphic-designs folder in your project
3. Name it something like "001-linkedin-ai-progress-post.png"

## Step 4: Optional - Generate Multiple Versions
You can repeat the process to create 2-3 variations to choose from.

## Alternative Method
If the above doesn't work in your version of Gemini:
1. Look for an "Image generation" or "Create image" option
2. Use the same prompt
3. Make sure to specify "square" or "1:1 aspect ratio"
