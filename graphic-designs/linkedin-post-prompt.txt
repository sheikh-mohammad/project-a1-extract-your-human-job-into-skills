Create a modern, minimal, professional tech-focused square image (1:1 aspect ratio) for a LinkedIn post about AI learning progress. The design should feature:

- Neutral background with soft blue/purple accent colors
- Clean layout with strong visual hierarchy
- Futuristic but simple design elements
- Space for text overlay at the top and bottom
- Tech-themed elements like abstract geometric shapes representing AI, neural networks, or digital progress
- No cartoon or playful illustrations - keep it professional
- Design should feel suitable for a tech student building in public
- Include subtle gradients and soft shadows
- Leave clear space for text overlay without cluttering
- Modern typography space suggestions
- Minimalist data visualization elements or abstract tech symbols
- Professional color scheme that works well for a LinkedIn post
- Abstract representation of learning progress, AI building, and skill development
- Sophisticated color palette with muted tones
- Balanced composition with proper visual breathing room
- High visual hierarchy with clear focal points
- Space for a title at the top and details at the bottom
- Professional aesthetic suitable for career networking
